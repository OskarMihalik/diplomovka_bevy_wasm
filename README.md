# A Bevy game template

Template for a Game using the awesome [Bevy engine][bevy] featuring out of the box builds for Windows, Linux, macOS, Web (Wasm), Android, and iOS.

# What does this template give you?

* small example ["game"](https://niklasei.github.io/bevy_game_template/)
* easy setup for running the web build using [trunk] (`trunk serve`) 
* run the native version with `cargo run`

WARNING: if you work in a private repository, please be aware that macOS and Windows runners cost more build minutes.
**For public repositories the workflow runners are free!**

# How to use this template?

 1. Click "Use this template" on the repository's page
 2. Look for `ToDo` to use your own game name everywhere
 3. [Update the icons as described below](#updating-the-icons)
 4. Start coding :tada:
    * Start the native app: `cargo run`
    * Start the web build: `trunk serve`
        * requires [trunk]: `cargo install --locked trunk`
        * requires `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
        * this will serve your app on `8080` and automatically rebuild + reload it after code changes
 
You should keep the `credits` directory up to date. The release workflow automatically includes the directory in every build.

### Updating the icons
 1. Replace `build/macos/icon_1024x1024.png` with a `1024` times `1024` pixel png icon and run `create_icns.sh` or `create_icns_linux.sh` if you use linux (make sure to run the script inside the `build/macos` directory) - _Note: `create_icns.sh` requires a mac, and `create_icns_linux.sh` requires imagemagick and png2icns_
 2. Replace `build/windows/icon.ico` (used for windows executable and as favicon for the web-builds)
    * You can create an `.ico` file for windows by following these steps:
       1. Open `macos/AppIcon.iconset/icon_256x256.png` in [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/)
       2. Select the `File > Export As` menu item.
       3. Change the file extension to `.ico` (or click `Select File Type (By Extension)` and select `Microsoft Windows Icon`)
       4. Save as `build/windows/icon.ico`
 3. Replace `build/android/res/mipmap-mdpi/icon.png` with `macos/AppIcon.iconset/icon_256x256.png`, but rename it to `icon.png`


# Getting started with Bevy

You should check out the Bevy website for [links to resources][bevy-learn] and the [Bevy Cheat Book] for a bunch of helpful documentation and examples. I can also recommend the [official Bevy Discord server][bevy-discord] for keeping up to date with the development and getting help from other Bevy users.

# Known issues

Audio in web-builds can have issues in some browsers. This seems to be a general performance issue and not due to the audio itself (see [bevy_kira_audio/#9][firefox-sound-issue]).
